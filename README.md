# GitHub Repo Validation

Python modules to check if repositories in alignment with desired standards.

You can use it, once installed, by executing the following command:

```sh
github_repo_validation --print_format=[INSERT DESIRED FORMAT csv OR jsonl]
```

It will output a repo.XXXX file that contains the measurable data on the repositories in question.

Configuration is managed in the config.py file.  Organizations allows you to adjust the list of desired `organizations` to match the HISC enterprise list of accepted topics for organizations.  The `repo_properties` defines the constrained list of properties of a repository we wish to pull.

```
API_TOKEN = [INSERT_GITHUB_API_TOKEN_HERE]
SOURCE_ROOT_URL = 'https://api.github.com'
SOURCE_HEADER = {'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json'}
REPO_PROPERTIES = ['full_name', 'topics', 'url']
ORGANIZATIONS = ['marketing',
                 'it',
                 'finance']
```

Python version 3.6 or greater is required with pip installed.

To install dependencies using pip execute the following command in development environment:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install dependencies using pip in the production environment use the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.prod.txt
```

To install the local directory for testing and execution purposes use the following command at the root of the project.

```sh
pip install -e .

```

#### Environment Variables

Before running any tasks, be sure to source the build environment variables file:

```sh
. build_variables.sh
```
